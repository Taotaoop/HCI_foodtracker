Overview 
bootstrap - style consistency, easy to get started with 
jquery - write less code and do more (written on their doc) 
chart.js - display to the user (visual display) 
indexedDB - maintain database in browser 
Libraries we used to help build our website were Bootstrap, jQuery, Chart.js and IndexedDB.

In order to achieve the designer goal We decided to use Bootstrap because it is easy to help us get started with. 
It also provides style consistency amongst our web pages. We used jQuery to help minimize the amount of code we write since there was a lot we wanted to accomplish.
Chart.js was used to bring a visual display to our web page. The data provided to the users get displayed in easy-to-follow pie and bar graph charts. 
To maintain a small database in our browser we used IndexedDB. We used this to keep the data saved when the browser was open.
